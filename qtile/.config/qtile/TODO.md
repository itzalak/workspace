# TODO

- [x] Split config in smaller files
    - [x] keys
    - [x] wallpapers
    - [x] layouts
    - [x] groups
- [x] Add a scratchpad
- [ ] Figure out how to handle 2 monitors
- [ ] Generalize border, margin and focus for layouts
- [ ] Look into KeyChord and EzKey
    - [ ] <https://docs.qtile.org/en/latest/manual/config/keys.html>
- [ ] Use python instead of bash scripts to load dunst and picom
- [ ] Define a new workflow and adjust shortcuts accordingly
    - [x] Make mod = alt
    - [ ] Refresh keybindings to match macos
- [ ] Update readme
    - [ ] add a qtile makefile
- [ ] Refactor and split makefile
- [ ] Rethink installation files
    - [ ] <https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles/-/blob/main/install.sh>
- [x] Make this project a poetry package - because python
    - [x] Might have to create a new folder called workspace to match requirements...
- [x] Consider running a few of the common apps and check their behavior
    - multiple things work fine
    - steam games were too slow, but otherwise working
- [x] Try all the installation scripts again
    - [x] sdkman
    - [x] ~~steam~~
        - steam has multiple requirements that might conflict with the development plans for using wayland or just to drop gdm-prime (which is not working)
- [ ] Read about noveau and nvidia
- [ ] Wayland
- [ ] Take a look at eww and consider if it is needed
- [ ] Check if colorscheme can be used from xresources or from decorator
- [ ] Can dunst use xresources
    - there seems to be a way to wrap dunst or load external files, needs more research
- [ ] wayland
- [ ] consider making the qtile folder a repository
    - [ ] consider also dependencies required to run qtile that might not be in the folder and might impact its use
    - [ ] like rofi...
